      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a paralegal, cat mom, and aspiring software developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from former Yugoslavia, but call Colorado home.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy baking, fly fishing, and have recently started learning how to ride a motorcycle.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To be retired.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Colorado, USA.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Problem solving is one of my stregnths. I am (perhaps oddly) looking forward to debugging. I am also looking forward to being in a career where there are new changes and things to learn. I don't see myself getting bored. I hope that I can use my skills to help rebuild the website for my church or make a website for my step-dad's business. </p>
